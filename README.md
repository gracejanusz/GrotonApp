# MyGrotonApp

Welcome to MyGrotonApp! This application, developed in collaboration with Seth Battis and the Groton School, is designed to interface with Blackbaud APIs to provide access to various school-related information, including student details, schedules, teachers, and other relevant data. 

**Please note:** This repository is intended as a demonstration of the work done and will not function fully on your computer without specific files containing personal information.

## Introduction

MyGrotonApp showcases integration with Blackbaud's APIs, offering a user interface for accessing:

- Student Information
- Class Schedules
- Homework
- Etc.

The app was built using Xcode, and the project files are included in this repository.
